# Lytix
Easy masternodes install script.

Just launch the script 
./lytixmenu.sh
and follow the instructions carefully!

PRE-REQUISITES:

- 1 computer that will host the wallet that you'll use to create the MN addresses, send the collaterals and keep your coins safe, 
  aka "cold wallet". You won't need to keep that one online, once you've setup your masternodes and checked that they're running.
  
- 1 VPS with at least 1 CPU & 2 GB ram & a bit of harddisk (20 Go is fine), with UBUNTU 16.04 -> with this kind of configuration you can setup up to
  15 Lytix masternodes (for now).
  
  
  To get your collateral transaction id & outputIndex, you need to wait at least 1 confirmation.
  
  To activate your masternodes, you need to wait at least 16 confirmations for your collateral transaction.
  
  Enjoy the best masternodes project ever =)
